# WebhookIntegrations
The simpliest solution for Discord Webhook integration with your Minecraft server.

# Features

- Chat logging
- Player quit/join messages
- Player death messages
- Advancement logging

# Usage
Download the .jar file from [here](https://github.com/rudynakodach/WebhookIntegrations/releases/latest) and drop it into your `Plugins` folder.

Once in game/console, to set the URL for your Webhook, use `/seturl <url>`.
If done correctly, you will be able to see messages appearing in the specified channel.
However, if you do not see the bot to start messaging, check the console for warnings from the plugin.

You can configure what messages will be sent and their format inside WebhookIntegrations/config.yml of your server's Plugins folder
